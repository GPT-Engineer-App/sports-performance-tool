# sports-performance-tool

A comprehensive sports performance database and assessment tool utilizing AGT (Autoregulation Graduated Repetitions Training) standards. This tool will include a detailed database of weight training exercises categorized by muscle groups and types, including compound and isolation exercises, with descriptions, primary and secondary muscles worked, recommended AGT standards for progression, safety tips, and a user-friendly interface for coaches and athletes. It will also feature a performance assessment tool that compares athletes' metrics against AGT standards to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement, generating personalized training programs. Safety guidelines, exercise variations, progress tracking, feedback mechanisms, resources on AGT and exercise science, and considerations for deployment, scalability, data security, and privacy are integral parts of the project.
